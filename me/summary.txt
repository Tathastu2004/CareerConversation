As a final-year B.Sc. IT (Honours) student with a deep passion for research and innovation, I am actively exploring the dynamic fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. My academic journey is enriched by practical experience, including my current role as a Research Intern at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad, where I have been working since May 2025, delving into deep reinforcement learning (DRL), machine learning (ML), and an additional skill. Previously, I served as a Summer Intern at ZENORA since May 2025, contributing remotely to web development, email marketing, and two additional skills. Additionally, I have been a Trainee at Pregrad since January 2025, further honing my technical expertise.
Earlier, I held the roles of Treasurer and Editorial Head of our university’s AI Club, where I managed finances, contributed to strategic initiatives, and oversaw content creation for our publications. These experiences allowed me to blend my organizational skills with my enthusiasm for AI, fostering both my leadership and technical abilities.
Proficient in Python , I am driven by the potential of technology to solve complex problems and enhance human potential. I am eager to apply my skills to impactful projects and collaborate on innovative solutions in AI and ML.
